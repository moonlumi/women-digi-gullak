            Investments in mutual funds can be made either in the lump sum method or through the Systematic Investment Plan method. Most of the time, women investors opt for the SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) method of investment in mutual funds because of the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul font-size:"20px">Monthly investments, sometimes as low as Rs. 500 can be deposited in their desired mutual fund</ul>
        <ul font-size"20px">Unlike the one time lump sum investment option, an investor can go for regular monthly or quarterly deposits for a defined tenure for great returns in the future</ul>
        <ul font-size:"20px">The SIP method helps in diversifying the portfolio of the investor as one can opt for more SIPs in numbers as compared to the lump sum method.</ul>
        <ul font-size:"20px">From low to medium risk-taking appetite, investment in mutual funds is for every type of women investor.</ul>
